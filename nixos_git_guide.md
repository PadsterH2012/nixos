# NixOS Configuration with Git

This guide will walk you through setting up a Git repository to manage your NixOS configuration.

## What is NixOS?

NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses a declarative configuration language to define the entire system state. This means you can specify everything from system packages to user settings in a single configuration file.

## Why Use Git for NixOS Configuration?

Using Git for your NixOS configuration offers several benefits:

* **Version Control:** Track changes to your configuration over time, allowing you to easily revert to previous states.
* **Collaboration:** Share your configuration with others and collaborate on changes.
* **Backup and Recovery:** Easily backup and restore your configuration.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Git Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub (or your preferred Git hosting platform) to store your NixOS configuration.

### 2. Structure Your Configuration

Create a directory structure for your NixOS configuration. A common structure is:

```
nixos/
├── configuration.nix
├── modules/
│   └── ...
└── services/
    └── ...
```

* **configuration.nix:** This file contains the main configuration for your system.
* **modules/:** This directory contains reusable configuration modules for specific components (e.g., networking, desktop environment).
* **services/:** This directory contains configuration for system services.

### 3. Configure Your System

Define your desired system configuration in `configuration.nix`. Refer to the NixOS manual for detailed information on available options: [https://nixos.org/manual/](https://nixos.org/manual/)

### 4. Link to Git Repository

Configure NixOS to use your Git repository as the source for your configuration. This typically involves setting the `nix.config` option in your `configuration.nix` file.

### 5. Commit and Push Changes

Commit your changes to your Git repository and push them to your remote repository.

## Best Practices

* **Modularize Your Configuration:** Break down your configuration into smaller, reusable modules.
* **Use Comments:** Add comments to your configuration files to explain your choices.
* **Test Your Configuration:** After making changes, test your configuration thoroughly before deploying it to your system.
